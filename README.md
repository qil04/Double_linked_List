[Overall it is pretty good project that tested the recursion and growth function. Any type can be restored in node of the double-linked list, like tuple. But initially I only limited to int and str, these two types. This is why I cannot pass the comprehensive test. Later, I gradually realize that you wanna test the type-agnostic, related to the type of node.val. Both, the workload of this project is really so heavy. Hhh, but it is project l know.]
